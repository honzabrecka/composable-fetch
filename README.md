A library that:

 1. brings composition to fetch requests
 1. solves most common tasks such as retries, timeouts, status code checking, ...

## Installation

```
npm install composable-fetch
```

## Example

```js
const { composableFetch, pipeP } = require('composable-fetch')

const log = console.log.bind(console)

const fetchJSON = pipeP(
  composableFetch.withBaseUrl('https://example.com/api'),
  composableFetch.withHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'),
  composableFetch.withHeader('Accept', 'application/json'),
  composableFetch.withEncodedBody(JSON.stringify),
  composableFetch.retryableFetch,
  composableFetch.withTimeout(1000),
  composableFetch.withRetry(),
  composableFetch.withSafe204(),
  composableFetch.decodeJSONResponse,
  composableFetch.checkStatus
)

fetchJSON({ url: '/foo' }).then(log).catch(log)
fetchJSON({ url: '/foo', method: 'POST', body: [1, 2, 3] }).then(log).catch(log)
```

For better overview of how composability may help take a look at `examples/composable.js` example.

## pipeP

Performs left-to-right function composition. Each function in composition must be unary. If function returns promise, than `pipeP` waits to its resolution before it calls next function in chain.

## tryCatchP

`tryCatchP` takes two functions, an async trier and an async catcher. The returned function evaluates the trier; if it does not throw, it simply returns the result. If it does throw, the catcher function is evaluated and result is returned. See [error handling & logging](#error-handling--logging) section.

## fetch

As noted above, `pipeP` expects unary functions. But because the `window.fetch` function is binary, it's necessary to wrap it with an unary lambda:

```js
type Request = {
  url: string,
  method?: string,
  headers?: object,
  body?: any,
}

const fetch1 = (req: Request) => window.fetch(req.url, req)
```

or use `composableFetch.fetch1` function which does this for you.

## Retries

When using `composableFetch.withRetry`, make sure that you are using `retryableFetch` instead of `fetch`.

```js
const { composableFetch, delays } = require('composable-fetch')

composableFetch.withRetry(3, delays.constant())
// retries after 1 sec, then again after 1 sec, then again after 1 sec

composableFetch.withRetry(3, delays.linear())
// retries after 1 sec, then after 2 secs, then after 3 secs

composableFetch.withRetry(3, delays.exponential())
// retries after 1 sec, then after 4 secs, then after 9 secs

composableFetch.withRetry(6, delays.limited(3, delays.linear()))
// retries after 1 sec, then 2 secs, 3 secs, then 1 sec, 2 secs, 3 secs
```

Retry is often used together with `composableFetch.timeout`. Please note that when the timeout is reached, the fetch request is not killed. In other words request will always finish.

Following pattern may be used in case you want retry when API responds with any bad status code (thanks to composability):

```js
const fetchJSON = pipeP(
  // ...
  composableFetch.retryable(pipeP(
    composableFetch.fetch,
    composableFetch.checkStatus// when this check fails => retry
  )),
  composableFetch.withTimeout(1000),
  composableFetch.withRetry(10),
  // ...
)
```

## Error handling & logging

To pretty print all failed requests (any reason):

```js
const { composableFetch, pipeP, tryCatchP } = require('composable-fetch')

const fetchJSON: tryCatchP(
  pipeP(...),
  composableFetch.logError(), // to console.error by default
)
```

In case you are interested in details of all requests made by your application, you can add simple `tap` function which performs desired side effect:

```js
const tap = (f) =>Â (v) => {
  f(v)
  return v
}

const fetchJSON = pipeP(
  // ...
  composableFetch.withHeader('Accept', 'application/json'),
  composableFetch.withEncodedBody(JSON.stringify),
  tap(log),
  composableFetch.retryableFetch,
  composableFetch.withTimeout(1000),
  // ...
)
```

The `fetch` API has one major "limitation". The response body can be read just once. It's good and effective, but sometimes you deal with an API that returns HTML encoded reponse even though you asked for JSON encoded one. Therefore there's `withClone` function that gives you second chance:

```js
const logError = async (error: any) => {
  if (error.res && error.res.cloned)
    console.log(await error.res.cloned.text()) // second read
}

const fetchJSON = tryCatchP(
  pipeP(
    // ...
    composableFetch.withRetry(10),
    composableFetch.withClone,
    composableFetch.decodeJSONResponse, // this will fail for any non application/json response
    // ...
  ),
  logError
)
```
